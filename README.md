In this blog, you will learn how to create a complete e-commerce website with HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT step by step. In my previous blog post, we created a responsive portfolio website with HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT. If you haven't checked it then do so because it contains a lot of golden tricks about CSS. I have already posted blogs on how to create an e-commerce website with HTML, CSS & JavaScript but I haven't created an e-commerce website with Product Image Zoom Effect.

If you haven't created any website before with HTML and CSS before don't panic because am going to guide you step by step so that you also get the same result as mine. Real quick, you can also convert this ecommerce website template to a dynamic ecommerce website using React, NodeJs and MongoDB. You can check out this video for an intro.
